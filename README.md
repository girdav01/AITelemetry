# AITelemetry
AI Telemetry project. Create a standard for AI infrastructure, systems and apps to generate cybersecurity Telemetry.

This project was initially presented to CoSAI TS 2 on November 12th.

RFC proposal: https://github.com/cosai-oasis/ws2-defenders/issues/6

# Problem 
AI systems runs in many different technology stacks locally, centrally in DCâ€™s or in Cloud. They have multiple components and with AI agents they could interact with many other systems.
Multiple AI security guidelines and some new standards and legislations are appearing 

# Solution
The industry and users need a common way to collect telemetry from AI systems and the technology stacks underneath to help manage  compliance and security of these AI systems. 
  -Inspiration for this come from Sysmon for Linux project
  -Make is vendor and standard agnostic from beginning 

# Use Case Description
Have the telemetry necessary to detect most of the risk or techniques that are reported in :
  -OWASP Top 10 LLM & ML
  -MITRE ATLAS
  -MIT AI Risk Repository
  -Etc
Support the complete DevSecOps/MLOps/LLMOps cycles

# What Telemetry would be needed?
Depend on Technology stack used but here are some general categories of events
